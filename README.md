# Student Email ID Generator

The objective of the project is to take first name, second name and department as the input and generate an email ID for the students who have enrolled in that college. The project also generates a password randomly which could be used by the student to log into organization's digital resources. In case a new mail is generated, the inbox capacity can be set to what the organization limits to.

The project allows the user to set alternate mail ID for reference. The user also gets the option to change the password according to his/her convenience.
